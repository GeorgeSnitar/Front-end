    		<p>Ukrainian folk cuisine is the same cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people.These are traditional vareniks, dumplings, buckwheat, juice, cheesecakes, potatoes, feathers, pancakes, and ceremonials - goat, cherry, lynx, wanders, paska, goose, cones.Ukrainian traditional drinks have a long tradition of traditional dishes. Although tea, coffee and vodka were not known by our ancestors, they were well able to make a delicious drink from what their fertile land was happy with. So, the favorite drinks of Ukrainians from ancient times were kvass and honey.</p>

      		<p>Fresh - this is fresh juice. This drink is incredibly useful, because, unlike the store juices in bottles and bags, it does not contain preservatives. And the concentration of nutrients and active ingredients in it just rolls over.Freshes are usually made from vegetables, berries and fruits. As for fruits, citrus fruits (especially oranges) and apples are most often used. Berries are used almost any, because they all differ juiciness. Some prefer vegetable fresh juices made from carrots, tomatoes, celery, and other ingredients. Anyway, the main component should be juicy, ripe, fresh and high quality.</p>

    	<p>Peeling vegetables. For cooking soups, main dishes, side dishes, washed vegetables are cleaned. Cleaning produce a sharp knife, the best special - grooved. It cuts a very thin layer, which is especially important for potatoes, since mineral salts and proteins are under its skin.
        After peeling, rinse the vegetables again in cold water and then chop them. You need to cut it neatly, diversely and beautifully: in cubes, cubes, circles, asterisks. Various cutting of vegetables diversifies the food and makes it possible to beautifully decorate the dishes.
        When cutting onions, it is recommended to dip the knife into cold water from time to time, then it will not “pinch” the eyes.</p>
